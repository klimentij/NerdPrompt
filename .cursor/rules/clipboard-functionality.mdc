# NerdPrompt Clipboard Functionality

NerdPrompt includes built-in clipboard functionality to improve workflow efficiency when working with LLMs.

## Key Clipboard Features

- **Prompt Copying**: The assembled prompt is automatically copied to clipboard immediately after creation before sending to LLM API. This allows users to paste it into other applications while waiting for the response.
- **Response Copying**: The LLM response is automatically copied to clipboard once received, replacing the prompt.

## Implementation Details

- Clipboard functionality is implemented in [np/core.py](mdc:np/core.py) using the pyperclip library.
- The prompt is copied to clipboard in the run() method, between steps 3 (prompt assembly) and 4 (output structure creation).
- The response is copied to clipboard in step 7 of the run() method, after LLM processing is complete.
- The global clipboard setting (always enabled by default) is stored in the ProjectState.copy_to_clipboard attribute in [np/config.py](mdc:np/config.py).

## Error Handling

Both clipboard operations are wrapped in try-except blocks to handle potential clipboard access issues gracefully:

- PyperclipException: Handled specifically for clipboard-related errors
- General exceptions: Caught to prevent clipboard issues from disrupting the main workflow

## Usage Notes

- No user action is required to enable clipboard functionality - it's automatic.
- The console displays clear messages indicating when content is copied to clipboard.
- If clipboard operations fail, warning messages are displayed but program execution continues.
